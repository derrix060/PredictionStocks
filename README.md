##Some considerations:
*   This project was created to make the creation of neural networks focused on prediction in the finance market easier.
*   All the datas from finance market is getting from Yahoo Finance API.
*   It use Java 1.8 and Eclipse IDE.


##To do:
*	default_trainingRate in Trainer and PropagationFactory
*	List<enumAttributesOfData> in NeuralNetwork, Data, HistoricalData, Trainer
*	Add learningRate in MainView (if ManhattanPropagation)
*   CRUD NN
* 	teste
