# PredictionStocks

Some considerations:
- This project was created to make the creation of neural networks focused on prediction in the finance market more easy.
- All the datas from finance market is getting from Yahoo Finance.
- This will be use to do my Term paper from FATEC.
- It's use Java 1.8 and Eclipse as IDE.


To do:
- Implement input and output DataSet. (output can be next day close price)
- dropout -> protect the overfitting.
- bias -> better adaptation, incresing the freedom.
- Change Interval as parameter to get Historical.
